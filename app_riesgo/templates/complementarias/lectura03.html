				<p>The heart is about the size of your fist, and you won’t believe the things that this very important organ can do. Prepare to be amazed by these cool heart facts.</p>
				<p>The heart is like a big pump made of muscles, and it constantly pumps blood throughout our bodies every minute of every day.</p>
				<p>These movements are called ‘involuntary’ which means you don’t actually have to think about making your heart beat; your brain does the work for you and passes on the message.</p>
				<p>It’s actually right in the middle of your chest between your two lungs. It is protected by your ribs. At least we know it’s in a safe spot!</p>
				<p>There are also four valves in the heart, and these are there to make sure that the blood only goes one way, in or out. Imagine the chaos it would cause if the blood was going in and out all at the same time.</p>
				<p>The heart weighs between 7 and 15 ounces (about 200 to 425 grams) which is about the same as a bottle of Ketchup! Pick up a bottle of ketchup and you’ll be able to feel how much your heart actually weighs.</p>
				<p>Now this is quite unbelievable. The average adult heart beats about 72 times a minute, 100,000 times a day and 3,600 times a year. During a person’s life their heart could beat more than 3.5 billion, yes 3.5 billion, times.</p>
